This project was built during the Auckland University Health Hackathon.

## Getting set up

Ensure you have RubyMotion installed

Install gems

`bundle install`

If you haven't set up Cocoapods before:

`pod setup`


Then install the Cocoapods:

`rake pod:install`


This app uses the camera for scanning QR codes, so it is best to run on
a physical device:

`rake device`
